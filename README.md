# ludo
Personalized Ludo ("Mensch ärgere dich nicht") board game for laser cutter. 
A perfect, individual (birthday) gift.

"Mensch ärgere dich nicht" is a very famous and long known board game in
Germany, with its simple rules suitable for young and old casual players.
I guess the english pendant is "Ludo", which is designed a bit differently,
but has the same rules.

This is an easily customizable engaving/cutting design for four players.
For how to reproduce it, please watch my video on youTube.

In this repository you will find all files you need to reproduce it. 

If you are going to use the xTool Studio software, you can just open the XCS file and edit
the text to customise. Please not that there are two canvas for the two halfs of the board.
If you use a different software (like Lightburn), just load the dxf and png files and add
text as you like.

You would also need:
- A laser cutter/engraver, like the Xtool P2S ( US: https://amzn.to/4nlifh2 D: https://amzn.to/3L0czvD). But any laser cutter, that can cut through 3-4 mm playwood and MDF would suffice.
